# README

This app can help you keep track of your friends' contact information.

I built it in preparation for a job that I didn't end up getting, but figured I'd keep the work public (why not?).

I built this app following a guide published by John Elder, and all credit is due to him for the result.

The app is deployed on Heroku, and is built with Ruby, Rails, and Bootstrap.
